A data collection and visualization of a tennis players stats. 

Idea behind the project:

I used to play Tennis professionally, but quit with the age of 17. My friend Lenny Hampel became a Pro with his highest Rank being No. 356 on the ATP Tour. Unlike for the Top players, there is no statistical data on players above No. 150 on the ATP Tour.

So my motivation was to create a dataset on Lenny Hampel's games, visualize it. Further, I would interview him, to see if his own subjective view about his game would match his statistical analysis (which he had never gotten before). Additionally I compared his stats, to Austria's No. 1 and world No. 3 Player Dominic Thiem.

So I posed 2 Hypothesis for this project:
H1: Lenny Hampel is overconfident in his assumptions due to self bias.
H2: Lenny Hampel's (No.359) stats would be worse than of Dominic Thiem (No. 3)

Lmitations arise as the data set had to be stripped down to only 31 matches, as the data turned out to be missing for many of Lenny Hampels hundred matches which he played during this period. Additionally we only compare Lenny's 2016 & 2017 data (where he was No. 359) to Dominic Thiem's overall data. Thus, one could argue that Dominic Thiems data set is more accurate to Lenny.
